        <h1>e-Visa Launch Eases Visa Application Process</h1>
        <p>
          As an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Indonesian government continues to innovate by creating digital-based public services. Recently, the Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human Rights launched an electronic visa (e-Visa) service aimed at simplifying public services, especially during the current pandemic. This also sends a positive message to foreign tourists planning to visit Indonesia after the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          By providing easier access for potential tourists, it is hoped that the tourism and creative economy sectors in Indonesia will grow post-pandemic, accompanied by the preparation of safe tourism destinations. With this service, foreign nationals no longer need to visit Indonesian Embassies abroad or the Directorate General of Immigration to process, collect, or have a visa sticker affixed to their passports. Now, they can simply apply for their visa online.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Here are the steps to apply for an e-Visa:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Go to the website <a href="https://visa-online.imigrasi.go.id/">https://visa-online.imigrasi.go.id/</a></li>
          <li>2. Register for an account</li>
          <li>3. Input your data and upload the required personal documents (individual/corporate)</li>
          <li>4. Wait for a notification with your username and password</li>
          <li>5. Log in to the application using your username and password</li>
          <li>6. Select the type of visa you are applying for, input the data, and upload the required documents</li>
          <li>7. Make the PNBP payment (ensure all data and requirements are correct, as payments are non-refundable)</li>
          <li>8. If approved, you will receive a notification via e-mail</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
          The e-Visa application can be done from anywhere. The verification process is faster, taking only 2 (two) working days, and the visa will be sent to the applicant.
        </p>
        <p>This streamlined process is a key factor in supporting the development of tourism in Indonesia post-pandemic. With this innovation, it is hoped that the number of tourists intending to visit Indonesian destinations will increase after the pandemic.</p>
